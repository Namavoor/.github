### Project communication

To facilitate effective communication and encourage discussion amongst everyone involved in a project, the use of "GitHub discussions" is highly recommended. This platform allows team members to ask questions, share new ideas, and engage in other forms of collaborative communication.

To ensure that discussions are organized and easy to follow, it is recommended that the "Labels" field be utilized. This allows for clear categorization of topics and makes it easier for everyone to find the information they need.

If voice and video communication is necessary, Google Meet is the ideal solution. This online meeting platform offers a seamless way to connect with team members, facilitate discussions, and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
