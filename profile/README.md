### Project location 


The  project is efficiently managed on the widely-used development platform, GitHub, under the organization named "Namavoor." Within this organization, there exist numerous individual repositories, each with its distinct purpose. One can analogize each repository as an autonomous folder within the broader organization's directory structure.

### Project documentation


To get more insight into the project, you can find all the necessary documentation for the project in the dedicated "[documents](https://github.com/Namavoor/documents)" repository. As a best practice, all documentation files shall be created and maintained exclusively in markdown format. To ensure high accuracy and consistency, any updates to the documents are only accepted through pull requests. Further, to be consistent, draw.io is used for block diagrams and PlantUML for sequence diagrams. To learn more about being consistent, please refer to the "documents" repository guidelines.

### Project communication

To facilitate effective communication and encourage discussion amongst everyone involved in a project, the use of "GitHub discussions" is highly recommended. This platform allows team members to ask questions, share new ideas, and engage in other forms of collaborative communication.

To ensure that discussions are organized and easy to follow, it is recommended that the "Labels" field be utilized. This allows for clear categorization of topics and makes it easier for everyone to find the information they need.
